### Breadth First Search
```
An Adjacency Linked List utilizing a matrix text file
to build the Breadth First Search. BFSTest runs the 
Breadth First Search algorithm. The BFSTest also checks
the validity of the matrix before using the BFS algorithm.

  Files
* BFS
* LinkedList
* Node
  need to be in the same path in order to run BFSTest
 
 The text files a1.txt, a2.txt, a3.txt can be used
 for this program to build the BFS. It should also 
 serve as an example to build other BFS
```
### Hash Table Chain
```
Hash Table using the Chain alogrithm. 
The file TestHashTable.java runs the algorithm.
  Files
* HashMap
* HashtableChain
* Node
* SLL 
  must be in the same path in order to run 
  TestHashTable
```
### Binary Search Tree (BST)
```
Binary Search Tree using left subtree for
values less than the root and the right sbutree
for values larger than the root.

This uses and inner private node class, and it 
can add nodes, remove nodes, check availability, retieve
left/right subtrees, and display the tree in 
prefix/postfix/inorder
```
### Palindromes
```
This program accepts input from the scanner 
and determines if the input is a Palindrome.
```
